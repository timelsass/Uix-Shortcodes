###How to use?

1.After activating your theme, you can see a prompt pointed out as absolutely critical. Go to **"Appearance -> Install Plugins"**.
Or, upload the plugin to wordpress, Activate it. (Access the path (/wp-content/plugins/) And upload files there.)

2.Go to your WordPress admin panel, edit or create a new post (or page). Youâ€™ll see our tiny little button in the toolbar, preceded by a separator.

3.You can overview the original styles to overwrite it. It will be on creating new styles to your website, without modifying original .css files. Go to **"Uix Shortcodes"** in the WordPress Administration Screens, then link to a specific tab like **"Custom CSS"**.


4.There is a second way, make a new Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) document which name to `uix-shortcodes-style.css` to your **templates directory**. You can connect to your site via an **FTP** client, make the changes and then upload the file back to the server. Once you have created an existing CSS file (**uix-shortcodes-style.css**), Uix Shortcodes will use it as a default style sheet to your WordPress Theme. Of course, Uix Shortcodes's function of **"Custom CSS"** is still valid.
